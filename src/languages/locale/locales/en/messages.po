msgid "You agree that the SendAfrika application shall be deemed a passive application that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over SendAfrika, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than the government of Ghana. These terms of use shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the government of Ghana, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and SendAfrika that arises in whole or in part from the SendAfrika website shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in the government of Ghana. These terms of use, together with the privacy policy and any other legal notices published by SendAfrika on the application, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and SendAfrika concerning the SendAfrika application. If any provision of these terms of use is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these terms of use, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of these terms of use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and SendAfrika's failure to assert any right or provision under these terms of use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the website, including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the government of Ghana, without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the courts of the government of Ghana and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. Any claim under these terms of use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. No recovery may be sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses. In the event of any controversy or dispute between SendAfrika and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the application, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time (not to exceed sixty (60) days), then either party may submit a dispute arising out of or relating to these terms of use for arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Ghanaian Alternative Dispute Resolution Act. Arbitration shall take place in Accra, Greater-Accra, and shall be conducted in the English language. Provided, however, that nothing contained in this section shall restrict or limit the right of either party to seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction."
